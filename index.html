                <p>The Tawa TKD Club was opened in 1980 as a part of the New Zealand Taekwondo Federation (N.Z.T.F). In 1984 Barry Hawkins was appointed the Club Instructor.<br>
                Under Barry Hawkins instruction many students benefited from his knowledge and passion to achieve National & Regional Titles, their Black Belts, increased sense of self esteem and self confidence and the physical benefits of Taekwondo. The club grew in size to encompass a Junior Class, Intermediate Class, Senior Class and a Women's Class. A number of former students went on to compete at international events, train with different clubs or different organisations.<br>
                In March 1994 the Tawa TKD Club was one of eight clubs which formed the Taekwondo Union of New Zealand T.U.N.Z. Founding members form the Tawa TKD Club were Barry Hawkins, Mike Murray & Shane Reid.
                As the Taekwondo Union of New Zealand grew, a number of member's from the Club were able to compete at international tournaments in Holland, Portugal and a number of different states in Australia on a number of different occasions.<br>
                The club was handed over to Mike Murray in January 1997. Mike has continued teaching all aspects of Taekwondo, supporting and promoting the growth of the Taekwondo Union of New Zealand and the Tawa TKD club. This could not have been done without the continual support of it instructors, its members and their families.<br>
                We have been able to develop friendships with different clubs and organisations and have opportunities for members to train with International Instructors, Coaches and Masters from Korea, Holland, Iran and from different states from Australia.<br>
                The philosophy of our club is to focus on promoting a family atmosphere with the discipline of a marital art. To instil an "I can" or "I will try" attitude into our students and encourage each and every student to reach their full potential in all aspects of the martial art. </p>

                <p>Tae Kwon Do is a Korean Martial Arts/Self Defence, which has its origins dating back more than 2000 years. Translated into English Tae Kwon Do means the "Art of striking with hand and foot", however "Art" is a poor translation; more appropriate translation would be "Philosophy" or "Way of life".<br>
                Tae Kwon Do Practitioners are known in the martial arts world for their kicking abilities, as the training's consists of approximately 80% feet and 20% hand techniques.<br>
                Tae Kwon Do is a martial sport with regular regional, national and international tournaments as well as being an Olympic sport.<br>
                The combinations of Sport Tae Kwon Do and the Martial Art side are balanced to improve all aspects of the Art.</p>
